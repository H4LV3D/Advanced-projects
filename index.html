        <p>i pretty like this because it is fun and easy to do. learning html looks like a big task but i have been good and followed the process up to the end i know i will master it. i pray so. Lets go spiritual, many peolple in the bible always wanted God to use them but these days many men and women just want to use God not know some equations can never be balaced or lets say never add up. come to think of it what is patnership with out two people in agreement, and then you dont want to do your part.</p></td>-->

        <!--<h3> Dialouge</h3>
       <p> Many people do not realise that there cannot be a man of God without the God of man. everything is just understanding. the moment you understand the concept behind a theory you hardly forget. immagination is the mother of creativity.Now back to me me me me so how are you doing. what  have you been up to? i am good still learning this html stuff and i seem to be getting better in it. i also love pentesting porpularly known as hacking. it is so much fun knowing how much damage you can wreck to someone's system from miles away anywhere in the world. the internet and technology are just two crazy things. a totally in depth understanding of both can land you an immersive impact to even nations.</p>-->

        <!--<h3>HTML AND CSS</h3>
        <p>i am officially done with learning html and css and i have been practising alot and i have dived into java script.By the end of the holiday i want to be very good in 6 programming languages which are (html, css, javascript, python, C, C++ and c#) and a little of java though. i reallywant to be a front end developer because i am really organized person and i love arrangement or packaging (what most people call it). the arragement the feeel, the looks, the packaging of any website is very important in the sense that it is the product before the real product, that is what the customer sees and feels online before approaching any human for further business. </p> -->

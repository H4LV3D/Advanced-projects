# Advanced-projects
## extra complex projects
### so i am begining working with git and github and it has been a perfect experience so far.
git is a version control system that tracks changes made to your file and projects made over time.
very useful when more than one person working on a paticular project.
i have learnt about 3 languages now. like a pro in html, advanced in css and beginer in javascript.
i still hope to learn three more like php and c and c++.
i will start learning python soon.
